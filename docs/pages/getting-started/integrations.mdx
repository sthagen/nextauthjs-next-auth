# Integrations

Here are the state of planned and released integrations under the `@auth/*` and `@next-auth/*` scope, as well as `next-auth`. It also includes community created and maintained integrations. Integrations listed as "Planned" are something we'd love help with! See the [help needed](#help-needed) section below.

  Is your framework not supported? You can easily contribute by creating a
  framework integration by [following this
  guide](/guides/creating-a-framework-integration).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Note that because of preventing breaking changes on package imports,
  `next-auth` is the only framework package which is not named following the
  `@auth/*` convention. This library initially was born as `next-auth` but [over
  the years has evolved](/contributors#history) to be framework agnostic.

### Help needed

In case you are a maintainer of a package that uses `@auth/core`, feel free to [reach out to
Bal√°zs](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44) or [info@authjs.dev](mailto:info@authjs.dev), if you want to collaborate on making it an official package, maintained in our repository. If you are interested in bringing `@auth/core` support to your favorite framework, we would love to hear from you!
