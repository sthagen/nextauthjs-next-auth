# Extending the Session

Auth.js libraries only expose a subset of the user's information by default in a session to not accidentally expose sensitive user information.
This is `name`, `email`, and `image`.

<Callout type="info">
  All callbacks are async functions, so you can also get extra information from
  a database or external APIs.
</Callout>

A common use case is to add the user's id to the session. Below it is shown how to do this based on the session strategy you are using.

## With JWT

To have access to the user id, add the following to your Auth.js configuration:

```ts filename="auth.ts"
  providers,
  callbacks: {
    jwt({ token, user }) {
      if (user) { // User is available during sign-in
        token.id = user.id
      }
      return token
    },
    session({ session, token }) {
      session.user.id = token.id
      return session
    },
  },
}
```

During sign-in, the `jwt` callback exposes the user's profile information coming from the provider.
You can leverage this to add the user's id to the JWT token. Then, on subsequent calls of this API will have access to the user's id via `token.id`.
Then, to expose the user's id in the actual session, you can access `token.id` in the `session` callback and save it on `session.user.id`.

Calls to `auth()` or `useSession()` will now have access to the user's id.

## With Database

If you are using a database session strategy, you can add the user's id to the session by modifying the `session` callback:

```ts filename="auth.ts"
  providers,
  callbacks: {
    session({ session, user }) {
      session.user.id = user.id
      return session
    },
  }
}
```

This will add the user's id to the session object. Notice that in this case, we are getting the id from the `user` object, not the `token`.
With the database session strategy, the `user` object is the user from the database, and there is no `token`.

Calls to `auth()` or `useSession()` will now have access to the user's id.

<Callout type="warning">
  The session object is not persisted server-side, even when using database
  sessions - only data such as the session token (id), the user, and the expiry
  time is stored in the session table. If you need to persist session data
  server-side, you must save it elsewhere. You can connect to the database in
  the `session()` callback to retrieve this information.
</Callout>
