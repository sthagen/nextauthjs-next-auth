### Sendgrid Setup

<Steps>

### Database Adapter

Please make sure you've [setup a database adapter](/getting-started/database), as mentioned earlier,
a database is required for passwordless login to work as verification tokens need to be stored.

### Setup Environment Variables

Auth.js will automatically pick up these if formatted like the example above.
You can [also use a different name for the environment variables](/guides/environment-variables#oauth-variables) if needed, but then you’ll need to pass them to the provider manually.

```bash filename=".env"
AUTH_SENDGRID_KEY=abc123
```

### Setup Provider

Let’s enable `Sendgrid` as a sign in option in our Auth.js configuration. You’ll have to import the `Sendgrid` provider from the package and pass it to the providers array we setup earlier in the Auth.js config file:

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Sendgrid from "next-auth/providers/sendgrid"

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [Sendgrid],
})
```

</Code.Next>
<Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="./src/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit"
import Sendgrid from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/sendgrid"

export const { handle, signIn, signOut } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [Sendgrid],
})
```

```ts filename="./src/hooks.server.ts"
export { handle } from "./auth"
```

</Code.Svelte>
</Code>

### Add Signin Button

Next, we can add a signin button somewhere in your application like the Navbar. This will send an email to the user containing the magic link to sign in.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="./components/sign-in.tsx"
import { signIn } from "../../auth.ts"

export function SignIn() {
  return (
    <form
      action={async (formData) => {
        "use server"
        await signIn("sendgrid", formData)
      }}
    >
      <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
      <button type="submit">Signin with Sendgrid</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

</Code.Next>
<Code.Svelte>

```html filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { SignIn } from "@auth/sveltekit/components"
</script>

<div>
  <nav>
    <img src="/img/logo.svg" alt="Company Logo" />
    <SignIn provider="sendgrid" />
  </nav>
</div>
```

</Code.Svelte>
</Code>

### Signin

Start your application, once the user enters their Email and clicks on the signin button, they'll be redirected to a page that asks them to check their email. When they click on the link in their email, they will be signed in.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Check our [Customising magic links emails](/) to learn how to change the look
  and feel of the emails the user receives to sign in.
</Callout>
