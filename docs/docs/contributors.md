## History

- NextAuth.js was originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/iaincollins">Iain Collins</a> in 2016 for Next.js.

- In 2020, NextAuth.js was rebuilt from the ground up to support Serverless, with support for MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens and built-in support for over a dozen authentication providers.

- In 2021, efforts have started to move NextAuth.js to other frameworks and to support as many databases and providers as possible.

- In 2022, <a href="https://github.com/balazsorban44">Bal치zs Orb치n</a> created Auth.js based on NextAuth.js, a runtime/framework independent core library that is the base of all Auth.js libraries going forward.
